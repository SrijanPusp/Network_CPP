This is a simple C++ networking project demonstrating a basic TCP Client and an HTTP Server. It's designed for learning purposes, showing how to establish connections and handle simple data exchange over a network. The code is cross-platform, meaning it can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The TCP Client can connect to a server and send a message. The HTTP Server is built to accept connections from multiple clients and respond to basic HTTP GET requests with a "Hello World!" message. This provides a foundational example of both client-side and server-side networking logic in C++.
